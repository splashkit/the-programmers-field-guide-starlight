## Variable

A Variable is a **container** into which you can store a value, which can then be retrieved later. The Variable allows you to store values you want to work with in your program, you store values in the variable so
that you can read them back later. The variable's themselves are either a [Global Variable](/docs/part-1/sequence-data/concepts#Global-Variable), [Local Variable](/docs/part-1/sequence-data/concepts#Local-Variable), or [Parameter](/docs/part-1/sequence-data/concepts#Parameter).

:::info Note

- A Variable is an **artefact**, you can create variables to store values in your programs.
- You can think of a Variable like a "box with an item in it". The Variable is the box, its value is the item within it.
- Each Variable has a ...
  - **Name** that can be used to refer to it.
  - **Value** that it is storing.
  - **Type** that determines the size of the Variable and how its value is interpreted.
- You use an [Assignment Statement](/docs/part-1/sequence-data/concepts#Assignment-Statement) to store a value into the Variable.
- You can **read** the value from Variable in Expressions.
- The Variable is **different** to its value:
  - The Variable is a container into which a value can be stored.
  - You can read the value from the Variable.
  - The Variable **is not** the value, it is a container into which the value is stored
