# Putting Together Digital Realities

This chapter is a little different from those that follow. For now, we are looking at the landscape around us so you can get a feel for the journey ahead and what will be important.

*So what do you need to take away from this?*

There are two key takeaways from this chapter: **abstraction** and **digital realities**.

Computers are hugely complicated if you try to think about everything that is going on within them. In order to get on top of this we must use abstraction to lift our thinking above physical reality and the events that are occurring within computer hardware. This allows us to start building digital realities, within which we can control every aspect of how they work, including how they interact with the real world. We just have to imagine them and craft the programming instructions to make them come to life.

So, at this stage, you donâ€™t need to worry too much about how transistors work to create gates within the computer. Nor do you have to worry about how they are designed to make computations function. You can live above these details - because of abstraction.

At the start of this journey, in Part 1, you will start to explore *programs as instructions*. Our first step will be to look at the different elements you can put within your source code to control the computer. We will explore how each element works, and what the computer will do when you use it. This will ensure that you can use each elements effectively, and understand how to relate to each other..

Your ability to work and engage with abstractions is important now. Programs are abstract - they are our ideas and thoughts manifested in code. You need to be able to hold these imaginary entities within your mind so that you can engage with constructing the code that will make them come to life.
