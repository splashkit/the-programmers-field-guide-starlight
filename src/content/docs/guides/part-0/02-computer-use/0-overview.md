# Overview

The first leg of our journey will introduce you to a new way of interacting with your computer. This will give you a whole range of new tools to play with, helping equip your toolbelt within new capabilities, and positioning you to be a powerful and productive computer user.

You will be familiar with the standard user experience of using a computer. Using a computer involves touching and swiping icons on a smart phone or tablet, or using a mouse and keyboard to interact with buttons and controls on windows drawn to a monitors. These elegant digital realities provide a convenient way to enable us to launch and use programs on our computers. But there is another world out there, one that underlies all of these elegant interfaces that you see.

This wasnâ€™t always the way that we interacted with computers, and these programs require significant effort to build these interfaces. They are great if you want to build a program for wide use, but are not really always needed. As a result, there are many tools that developers and computing professionals use that do not have graphical interfaces. Instead, these tools have simple command line interfaces where you interact with it by typing commands and responding to prompts at a terminal.

The fact these programs have simple text driven interfaces can be a challengage at the start, but this makes these programs much easier to automate and you can combine them in interesting ways to quickly and easily achieve a range of useful tasks.

In this chapter, you will learn to use the command line and about the environment within which programs run. This will help you understand the environment within which your programs will run, give you experience with low level tools, and help you better understand issues that you encounter when things go wrong.

By the end of this chapter you will be able to:

- Access and interact with your computer via a terminal.
- Use command line programs to perform a range of computing tasks.
- Explain the operating environment of programs, the means of sending input to a program, and interacting with the output fron a program.
- Use pipes and redirection to move data between programs, and to files.
