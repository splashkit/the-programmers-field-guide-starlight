# Concepts

## The Terminal

Once upon a time, computers were rare, large, and shared between many users. Each computer (picture a whole room, not something in your pocket) had a number of connected monitors and keyboards to allow people to access the computer. These monitors and keyboards were built into a single box called a **terminal**. To use the computer, you would go to the terminal and respond to the prompts the computer provided you with.

The terminal gave you access to the low-level workings of the computer.

**ADD IMAGE - terminal machine**

Now, computers are everywhere, but we still need a way of access it at a lower level. The name *terminal* has stuck, but now the **Terminal** is a **program** that gives you command line access to the computer. With command line access the computer will give you a prompt to enter commands. You can type text, and hit *enter* (or *return*) to have the computer run that command. Programs you run at the terminal output details back to the Terminal for you to read, and interactive programs can also read input from you via this same Terminal.

Being about to interact with programs via the Terminal will give you access to an entirely new world of computing. There are utilities and tools that you can run to do many useful tasks. These tools can be combined together, scripted, and built into programs. This kind of scripting will help you in analysing data, setting up servers, scripting repetitive tasks, and understanding errors or issues in getting complex programs to work.

Getting some experience with the command line will mean that you can start using these tools yourself. Understanding how they work, will also help you understand the options available to you and help you debug any errors that occur.

The trouble with command line applications is that you need to remember the commands. There isnâ€™t a convenient interface that tells you what to do - you are in control. You can do more, with more flexibility, but with less guidance. Think about how you will remember these tools. Maybe create a cheat sheet you can refer to.

**ADD SOMETHING ON MEMORISATION**

## The Shell

*What commands can I enter at the terminal?*

The **Terminal** program provides a text environment, allowing text input and output much like the old physical terminals once did. We need something within the computer that receives the text you type and can respond to it. We call this program a **shell**.

*Why is this called a shell?*

This is a *nut* analogy. The shell is a thin wrapper around the kernel or core of the nut. In the computer, the shell is the command interpreter that gives you access to the core of the operating system. The core of the operating system maintains the same nut (or seed) analogy, with the core being known as the **kernel**. The kernel provides tools to abstract away many of the lower-level details related to interacting with the computer hardware. In this way, all other programs *grow* out of the kernel - as plants grow out of the kernel of a nut or seed.

**ADD IMAGE - application`<--> kernel <-->` CPU, Memory, etc... see wikipedia**

A **shell** program runs within each terminal to interpret your commands and instruct the kernel to perform the actions you request. This is an interactive program that will display prompts to you, at which you enter your commands by typing text. There are several different shell programs you can choose from, each of which has its advantages and disadvantages. The shell we are going to use for this journey will be **Z shell**. This is a shell built into most modern Unix operating systems.

A shell program is very simple. It provides a text prompt at which you can enter commands. The shell reads the text you entered, and performs an action based on this text. You can use the shell to perform operations like copying and deleting files, starting programs, and more.

### Accessing the Shell

Ok, enough talk. We need to get our hands dirty and start playing with the Terminal.
